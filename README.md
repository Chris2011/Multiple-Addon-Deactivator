Multiple-Addon-Deactivator (Unmaintained)
==========================

I stopped the development for soem reasons. First, I don't use FF anymore, second this plugin needs a whole refactoring because it uses old technologies like XUL. So if anyone of you have interests, fork it or create it from scratch. Thx for your patience and the usage of my plugin :)

Multiple Addon Deactivator (M.A.D.) can (de)activate 1, many or each add-on at the same time.
